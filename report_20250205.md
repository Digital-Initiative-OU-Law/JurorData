**Timestamp:** 2025-02-05 10:49:46.075716

**Scenario:** You are a juror sitting on a joint American federal criminal trial for armed robbery against two co-defendants, George and William. Because this is a joint trial, both George and William sit at the defense table during trial. As a juror, you are tasked with evaluating whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that William—not George—committed robbery.

At trial, the prosecution introduces pretrial police interrogations of George. You find George’s statements to be credible, meaning you believe him. In these pretrial police interrogations, George stated: “Me and  [blank]  committed the robbery.”

**Number of Jurors:** 24

## Simulation Questions and Responses
### Question 1: On a scale of 0 to 10, how much more likely did George's statement make it that you will find William guilty of robbery?
#### Responses:
- **Bob Miller**: ⠋ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏ ⠋ ⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠴ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏ ⠋ ⠙ ⠹ ⠹ Hi there! As a juror in this trial, I have to base my decision on the evidence presented in court and beyond a reasonable doubt. After carefully listening to George's statements during the pretrial police interrogations, I would rate the likelihood of William's guilt as a 6 out of 10. George's statement that he and another person committed the robbery suggests that William was involved, but without more concrete evidence tying William directly to the crime, I cannot be certain of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Bob Johnson**: Hey there! So, I gotta say, George's statements really made me think. He seemed like a straight shooter, ya know? And what he said about committin' the robbery with someone... it sounds pretty convincing. Now, I ain't no lawyer or nothin', but if George is tellin' the truth and he was there, then it stands to reason that William was in on it too, right? So, I'd say George's statements made it like, real likely that William did the robbery, maybe a solid 8 outta 10.
- **Laura Smith**: ⠙  As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that George's statement makes it for finding William guilty of robbery as a 6 out of 10. While George's statement suggests that he and another person committed the robbery, it does not directly implicate William. Additionally, I would like to see more evidence before making a final decision.
- **Michael Brown**: I would rate George's statement as a 6 out of 10 in making it more likely that William committed robbery. While George's statement suggests that he and another person, who is not William, committed the robbery, it does not entirely rule out the possibility that William was involved. Additionally, I find George's credibility to be high based on his demeanor during the pretrial police interrogations, so I am inclined to believe his version of events. However, without more direct evidence linking William to the robbery, I cannot say with absolute certainty that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Emily Johnson**: As a juror, I would rate the impact of George's statement on my likelihood of finding William guilty as a 6 out of 10. While George's statement suggests that he and another person committed the robbery, it does not directly implicate William. Without more direct evidence linking William to the crime, I cannot say with certainty that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **John Wilson**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that William committed robbery as a 7 out of 10 after hearing George's statement. George's admission that he and someone else committed the robbery suggests that William was involved in the crime, but it does not prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution still needs to provide additional evidence linking William directly to the robbery for me to find him guilty.
- **Alice Johnson**: ⠙   Sure, I can do that! Here is my response as Alice Johnson, the fictional juror:

I would say that George's statement made it about a 7 out of 10 likelier that William committed robbery. Based on what George said, it seems like he and William did the robbery together, so it's likely that William was involved too. However, I still need to hear more evidence before I can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Jane Miller**: Hey there! So, I gotta say, George's statements really made an impact on me. He seemed like a credible guy, ya know? And what he said just made sense - him and another dude did the robbery. Now, I ain't no expert, but it seems pretty clear to me that William was in on it too. So, if George says they both did it, then I'm thinkin' there's a good chance William was involved. Like, on a scale of 0 to 10, I'd say his statement made it like, 8 or 9 times more likely that William did the robbery. Yeah, that's how confident I am in my verdict.
- **Michael Smith**: Hey there! As a juror, I gotta say that George's statements made it way more likely that William committed robbery. I mean, if George is admitting to committing the crime with someone, and he's saying that person is William, then it stands to reason that William was involved too, right? I'd say it's a solid 8 out of 10 in terms of how much more likely George's statement made it that William is guilty.
- **Michael Smith**: Hey there! So, let me think... I mean, if George said he and someone else committed the robbery, that's a pretty big deal, right? Like, it's not exactly a smoking gun, but it's definitely a lead worth exploring. Now, I gotta say, I found George's statements to be pretty credible, so if he's saying he and someone else did it, then that someone else must be William, right? So, on a scale of 0 to 10, I'd say George's statement made it about an 8 or 9 more likely that William is guilty. But hey, we gotta look at all the evidence before we make any big decisions here!
- **David Brown**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that George's statement made it more likely that William committed robbery as an 8 out of 10. Based on my interpretation of George's statements, it seems clear that he and William collaborated on the robbery, and William's involvement is supported by George's admission. However, I cannot reach a guilty verdict without sufficient evidence directly implicating William in the crime.
- **David Brown**: Hey there! So, I gotta say, George's statement definitely made an impact on me as a juror. I mean, he's saying that he and someone else - who we can assume is William - committed the robbery. That's pretty damning evidence, if you ask me. I'd say it makes it around an 8 out of 10 in terms of how much more likely I am to find William guilty of robbery. The fact that George is implicating himself and someone else definitely adds weight to the prosecution's case. Now, I wanna hear more about William's side of things before I make my final decision, but based on what we've heard so far, it looks like William might be in a pretty tough spot.
- **Bob Jones**: Okay, I'll do my best to simulate the viewpoint of Bob Jones, a fictional juror:

George's statement made it about a 7 or an 8 out of 10 more likely that William committed robbery. Based on what George said, it seems pretty clear that he and William did the robbery together. Since George appears to be telling the truth, I believe his statements about William committing the robbery are probably accurate. However, I still need to hear all the evidence before making a final decision.
- **Alice Wilson**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that William committed robbery as a 7 out of 10 based on George's statement. The fact that George implicated himself and another person in the commission of the crime suggests that he is admitting to his own involvement and may be attempting to shift blame onto William. However, without additional evidence directly linking William to the robbery, I cannot conclusively find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Bob Jones**: Hey there! So, let me think... after hearin' George's statements during the pretrial police interrogations, I'd say it made it about a 7 or an 8 outta 10 more likely that William committed robbery. Now, I know what you're thinkin', "Why so high?" Well, let me tell ya, it's because George seemed like a real stand-up guy, and his word carries a lot of weight with me. Plus, he explicitly said him and someone else (who I'm assuming is William) committed the robbery. That's pretty darn convincing if you ask me!
- **Michael Smith**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that George's statement made it more likely that William committed robbery as an 8 out of 10. George's statement suggests that he and William jointly committed the robbery, which implies that William was involved in the crime. Additionally, the fact that George is pointing fingers at William suggests that he may be trying to deflect blame away from himself, which could indicate that William is more culpable. However, I will need to consider all of the evidence before making a final decision.
- **John Davis**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that George's statement makes it for finding William guilty of robbery as an 8 out of 10. Based on my understanding of the evidence presented so far, George's statements seem credible and suggestive of his involvement in the crime. However, I cannot ignore the fact that William is also sitting at the defense table and has the right to a fair trial. Therefore, I must carefully weigh all the evidence before making a decision.
- **Jane Wilson**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that William committed robbery as a 7 out of 10 after hearing George's statement. Based on my understanding of the case facts, George's admission of involvement in the crime alongside an unnamed accomplice suggests a strong possibility that William was also involved. However, I cannot make a final decision without considering all the evidence presented during the trial.
- **Michael Smith**: ⠙   Okay! Let me put myself in the shoes of Michael Smith, the fictional juror...

Well, I gotta say, George's statement sure made it more likely that William committed robbery. I mean, if George is saying he and someone else did it, then it stands to reason that William must've been that someone, right? I'd say it made it a solid 8 out of 10 more likely that William is guilty. The only thing that might make me less sure is if there was some other evidence that pointed elsewhere, but based on what we've heard so far, it looks like William is the one who did it.
- **David Brown**: ⠙   Hey there! So, I gotta say, George's statements were pretty convincing. He seemed like a straight shooter, you know? And what he said about committing the robbery with someone else, that really stuck with me. I'd say, based on what George said, it makes it around a 7 or an 8 outta 10 likelier that William is guilty of robbery. Now, don't get me wrong, I gotta look at all the evidence before I make my final decision, but geez, George's words sure do make it seem like William was involved.
- **Emily Miller**: Okay, I can do that! Here is my response as Emily Miller, the fictional juror:

George’s statement made it much more likely that William committed robbery because George admitted to committing the crime with someone else, and William was that person. Knowing that there were two people involved in the crime and that George confirmed William's involvement makes it more believable that William participated in the robbery. I would rate the likelihood that William committed the robbery as a 9 out of 10 based on George’s statement.
- **Alice Smith**: Hi there! As a juror, I would rate George's statement as an 8 out of 10 in terms of making it more likely that William committed robbery. Based on my understanding of the situation, it seems like George is taking responsibility for the crime and implicating William, which suggests that there may be some truth to his statements. Additionally, the fact that George is willing to admit to the crime with William's name inserted into the statement implies that they both played a role in the robbery. However, I still need to consider all of the evidence before making a final decision.
- **David Smith**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood of William's guilt as a 7 out of 10 after hearing George's statements. The statements made by George during the pretrial police interrogations seem credible and suggest that he and William committed the robbery together. However, I would still need to carefully consider all the evidence presented in court before making a final decision.
- **Emily Williams**: As a juror, I would rate the likelihood that George's statement made it more likely that William committed robbery as a 7 out of 10. George's statement suggests that he and another person, who is not William, committed the robbery together. This raises some doubt about William's involvement in the crime, but it also suggests that there may be other evidence linking William to the robbery that has not yet been presented in court. Without more information, I cannot say with absolute certainty that William is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
